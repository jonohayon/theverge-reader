# theverge-reader
RSS feed reader for The Verge website built using NodeJS, Express and Ratchet.
Acts as an web-app on iPhones (add to home screen).

# Why have I built it?
Because I wanted an easy way to read The Verge's posts without any extra application (for example Feedly).
Right now shows the posts on the direct site, but still working on getting to make it like an actuall app.
